# Python Programming

Collection of standalone Python Command line programs that I coded and tested to learn about Python language.
Based on course Python Programming (Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Autumn 2022, by teacher Kari Silpi√∂.)

Code have been tested using Viope code checker.
